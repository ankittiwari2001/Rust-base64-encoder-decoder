# Rust-base64-encoder-decoder

This repository contains a basic Rust program that demonstrates how to encode and decode strings using the base64 encoding algorithm. The program utilizes the popular `base64` crate to showcase the encoding and decoding functions.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```
https://github.com/ankittiwari2001/Rust-base64-encoder-decoder.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd rust-base64-encoder-decoder
```
3. Run the Rust program:
```
cargo run
```

This will execute the program, encoding and decoding a sample string, and displaying the results.


Feel free to explore the code in `main.rs` to understand how the base64 encoding and decoding functions are implemented.
